This program is designed for cleaning and optimizing a computer through a simple interface. Hereâ€™s what it does:


Clears temporary folders, cache, recycle bin, and downloads. 

Flushes the DNS cache to improve network speed.

Runs in the background and appears in the system tray, making it easy to open or exit.

Can be set to launch automatically with the system.

Each function handles a specific cleaning task, and the program also shows how much disk space was freed after cleaning.
